# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
An ML model predicting the survival rate in the Titanic using ML algorithms and ANN

The model has been built on the Logistic Regression,Decision Tree, Random Forest and Support Vector Classifier algorithms. To further determine accuracy, another model has been built using Artifical Neural Networks.
